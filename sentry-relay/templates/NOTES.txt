Thank you for installing my-sentry-relay!

To test your Relay instance:

1. Port forward the service:
   kubectl port-forward svc/{{ include "my-sentry-relay.fullname" . }} 3000:3000

2. Update your DSN to point to Relay:
   Original DSN:  https://<key>@oX.ingest.sentry.io/<project_id>
   Relay DSN:     http://<key>@localhost:3000/<project_id>

3. Test with sentry-cli:
   export SENTRY_DSN='http://<key>@localhost:3000/<project_id>'
   sentry-cli send-event -m 'A test event'

4. Check in your Sentry project for the event.
